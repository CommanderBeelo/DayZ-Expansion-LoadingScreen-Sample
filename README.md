## Troubleshoot

### What is the folder "Workbench" ?
Some tools we use to create and work on mods. You do not need to keep this folder, but if you want to use something from our tools you are allowed to use them :)

### What is "MultiMapsLoadingImages.json" for ?
It's a example file to show what you can do, if you want to load only one picture when joining a chernarusplus server and another picture on a livonia (enoch) server you can !

### How do I make a edds file ?
Near the end of this page you should have a quick tutorial: https://github.com/salutesh/DayZ-Expansion-Scripts/wiki/%5BModding%5D-Adding-custom-loading-screen

### The screen is white !
The path of your pictures is incorrect or the naming is wrong. The mod was not able to find the picture(s).

It could also be because your DayZ Tools "Addon Builder" doesn't include json files.

### I have compiled my mod but I don't see anything new, it's like if my mod was not there.
The path to your scripts is incorrect or it failed to compile the pbo containing the scripts.
